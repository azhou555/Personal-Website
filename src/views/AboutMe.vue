      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <h6>I'm currently a sophomore at University of Maryland @ College Park, pursuing a double degree in Mathematics(Applied Mathematics) and Computer Science. </h6>
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>
            Noticeable coursework includes Object Oriented Programming I and II, Introduction to Computer Systems, Intro to Networking, Intro to AI,
            Software Design, and Computer Graphics. I'm currently taking Organization of Computer Languages and Algorithms. Contact me to learn more
            about any specific courses. Next semester, I'm considering Advanced Data Structures, Introduction to Compilers, Database Design, or
            Introduction to Artificial Intelligence(I'm planning to take two courses, at least one among these four). 
            <br> <br>
            My favorite language is Java, but I am experienced in Python, C, & Javascript as well. I've dabbled in C++, PHP, C#, for limited projects, and
            am currently learning OCaml and Rust in class. 
            <br> <br>
            I've also worked with a large range of different libraries. Most notably, Pandas and NumPy. I am also currently learning Langchain, and hope 
            to flesh out a project using it soon. 
            <br> <br>
            I'm currently really interested in machine learning and LLMs, but I'm open to learning anything and everything.

        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
            Noticeable coursework includes Discrete Structures, Differential Equations, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. 
            I'm currently taking Introduction to Probability Theory, and plan to take Advanced Calculus I and Theory and Methods of Statistics 
            next semester. 
            <br> <br>
            I've always been interested in mathematics, long before I ever started coding. When I enrolled in university, I wasn't sure if I was going to keep
            studying math because I knew that my priority would be Computer Science. When I learned about the Applied Mathematics track offered by UMD,
            I committed to it and also decided to go the extra mile and aim for a doubl degree.

        <h3>
            Extracurriculars/Volunteer Work
        </h3>
        <p>
            I'm a big believe in the importance of volunteering and giving back to my community. Luckily, I've had many opportunities to
            align my interests in a way that allows me to help others out. 
            <br> <br>
            I've been graced by the kindness of many coaches in my past, which led to me coaching around my neighborhood and the founding of the King Farm
            Tennis Team. It had a rough start, but I am eternally grateful to all the students and parents who trusted me to see it through and showed up
            for my lessons. 
            <br> <br>
            I also had the pleasure of teaching and grading SAT Math Prep and Java II at the ACTON Institute of Computer Science. I greatly appreciate all the students
            who listened attentively and engaged with the class even though it was online. I hope everyone got a good score, and are considering a career
            in computer science. 
            <br> <br>
            Aside from coding and studying, I spend as much time on the tennis courts as I can. My suitemates are accustomed to me coming back in the middle of
            night, or leaving for half the day to play.

            Miscellaneous Skills
        </h3>
        <p>
            Aside from my solely programming related skills, I am experienced in a variety of other technical skills. Aside from the Microsoft 365 suite, 
            I've worked with a variety of Adobe programs including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Acrobat, Express, and Animate. Mainly through my coursework, 
            I've spent a lot of time working with MATLAB. As part of the First-year Innovative Research Experience(FIRE) program at UMD, I've also 
            worked heavily with R/RStudio through Posit Cloud for data manipulation and analysis. 
            <br> <br>
             I've also worked pretty extensively with Final Cut Pro X to make documentaries, videos, and short films. I've dabbled with Unity, 
             Android Studio, Blender, and AutoCAD among other applications.
